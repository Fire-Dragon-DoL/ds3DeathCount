# ds3DeathCount

Forked version of the original ds3DeathCount with support for file-writing deaths.

## Requirements

- .NET Framework 4.5(.2)

## Usage

1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/Fire-Dragon-DoL/ds3DeathCount/releases/download/v0.1.0/ds3DeathCount.zip)
2. Unzip it
3. Create a new file named `ds3DeathCount.conf` in the same place where `DarkSouls_DeathCount.exe` is found
4. Decide a path where you want your "deaths" to be written on. For example, I want my deaths to be written in a "deaths.txt" file on my desktop. Take note of this path, for example I chose `C:\Fire\Desktop\mydeaths.txt`
5. Inside `ds3DeathCount.conf`, write the path chosen in the previous step
6. Save and close the file
7. Start the program, if Dark souls is running you should find a file at specified path with content the number of times you died in game. It keeps itself up-to-date whenever you die
